 four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer 
 the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said 
 the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk> 
 the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said 
 the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters 
 the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said 
 the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine 
 more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained

 by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed 
 about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s 
 areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used 
 workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters 
 workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area 
 there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk> 
 but you have to recognize that these events took place N years ago 
 it has no bearing on our work force today
